# nativeMobileJob
Fetch job listings directly from the career pages of mobile-first companies.

# Motivation
Finding mobile jobs on LinkedIn is often unhelpful due to the absence of filters such as minimum target iOS version, team size, and tech stacks. Moreover, mobile jobs nowadays encompass not only native mobile positions but also hybrid framework roles like React Native and Flutter.

To retrieve native mobile jobs, I select companies with dedicated mobile teams that develop apps using native technologies.

# Contribution
